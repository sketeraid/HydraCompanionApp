Hydra Companion is designed with user privacy as a core principle. This policy explains what information the application handles, how it is used, and what is not collected or shared.

1. Information Collected

- Any personally identifiable information (PII)

2. Local Data Processing
Any data generated or used by Hydra Companion (such as settings, preferences, or local logs) remains strictly on the user’s device.  
This information is never uploaded, transmitted, or synced to any external service.

3. No Data Sharing
